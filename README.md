#Waibee's Hub
Hey there visitor! This is my personal website. Here, you will find more information about myself, my projects and achievements, and my course notes from university. It was my aim to have a good-looking (still working on acheiving it) website, and to also help fellow students by providing my course notes. I understand the importance of having good course notes right from the beginning, it makes a big difference. And I want to be that!

If you find content on this website useful, I would love to hear from you. You can reach out to me via e-mail at 11yashbarve@gmail.com

Unlike most of my friends, I am not using a template to build my website. Instead I prefer learning by doing and showcasing my own work. Every single line of code used to build this website is my own.

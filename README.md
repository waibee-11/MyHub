Hello there visitor!

First of all, I am incredibly grateful for being where I am today. Being able to study with some really intelligent minds at the University of Waterloo and Wilfrid Laurier University is super fun. With that being said, I always strive to get better at whatever I am doing. I believe with the pace that today's world is moving, it is super important to be relevant in terms of your skills and knowledge.

In the past, I have been fascinated by many things such as automobiles, aeronautics, graphic designing, and website-making. But, all those, as I have now discovered, were temporary interests. 2 months ago, I was introduced to an introductory Machine Learning course. And I fell in love with it. So, currently, it's ML that has taken over me. With an interest in Mathematics and CS, I feel ML could be a long-term interest. I have completed the ML and DL Specialisations by Andrew Ng on Deeplearning.ai. I am now familiar with concepts like Supervised and Unsupervised learning algorithms, Bias/Variance analysis, Neural Nets, RNN's, CNN's, and Reinforcement learning. I have also made some cool projects involving some of these models.

Leaving the academics aside, I am a fanatically devoted to Formula 1. I run a F1 account on Instagram, where post some F1-content. I am also a cricket fan, especially Mumbai Indians in the IPL. I also listen to a lot of music. I love Bollywood music, and Lofi Hip-Hop the most, but I also have my favourite English songs. I also am physically active. I enjoy those 7 mins work-outs. I love playing cricket, table-tennis, and occasionally badminton. And obviously, like most other Indians, I love eating a lot of food (any cuisine!).

Thanks for visiting my profile again. I wish you all the very best in life!
